Now there is a round table to decide which papers should be accepted in a conference, please discuss and review the paper in ['A Novel Merging Framework for Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Blockchain Systems', 'An Interpretation Method for Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Based on GNNExplainer', 'A DRL-Based Edge Intelligent Servo Control with Semi-Closed-Loop Feedbacks in Industrial IoT']. In your questions, there should be the paper's name.

You should evaluate each paper accurately based on each of the following standards one by one:

    1. The paper should have a strong research background and address an important question.
    2. The paper should have a complete paper structure.
    3. The paper should have a clear theme, analysis, and conclusion.
    4. The content of the paper must be original to enhance the existing knowledge system in the given topic area.
    5. Experiments, statistics, and other analyses must be conducted in accordance with high-tech standards and described in sufficient detail. Experiments, data, and analysis should be able to support the current conclusion.
    6. If there is algorithm design, it is necessary to ensure that the algorithm is feasible and effective.
    7. The conclusion must be clear, correct, reliable, and valuable.
    8. The paper should have a certain contribution and driving effect on the given thematic area.
    
Pay attention to using uniform evaluation standards for all papers.

After evaluating all the standards, chiefeditor gives a final score of each paper based on the review comments and discuss process. (The maximum score is 100, which should be accurate to two decimal places.) Then, write the papername, score, and the review comments of each paper into the designative txt file.
The review comments should be personalized and pertinence and it should include the advantages and disadvantages of corresponding paper.

Dont write the writeinfo function again!
Note that the review comments should use a string and should not have a "\n". 
The score must be a string.
The papername that you wanna write should not have a ":".

Just terminate the conversation after all the papers are written into the txt file.

Start the work now.

***** Response from calling tool (call_CTBkIsRNIl3hzvb2tyKYB0Wp) *****
Yes, the paper "A Novel Merging Framework for Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Blockchain Systems" does have a strong research background and addresses an important question. It tackles the challenge of merging diverse blockchain systems, which is crucial as blockchain networks expand and the need for integrating disparate ledgers becomes more pressing. The paper presents two solutions, Homogeneous Chain Consolidation (HCC) and Heterogeneous Multi-chain Integration Architecture (HMIA), to address this issue. These solutions are evaluated based on consensus times, block sizes, and ledger growth, demonstrating their feasibility and negligible performance impact. The research contributes to the field by offering insights into merging blockchains and addressing critical challenges in interconnected decentralized networks.

Yes, the paper 'An Interpretation Method for Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Based on GNNExplainer' has a strong research background and addresses an important question. It focuses on the growing threat of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for automated host intrusion detection. The paper highlights a significant barrier to the practical adoption of GNN-based intrusion detection systems, which is their lack of interpretability. By introducing an interpreter to enhance the understanding of how these systems make decisions, the paper addresses a critical need in the field of cybersecurity. This approach not only aids in refining security measures but also contributes to the development of more robust intrusion detection strategies, making it a relevant and important research question.

Yes, the paper 'A DRL-Based Edge Intelligent Servo Control with Semi-Closed-Loop Feedbacks in Industrial IoT' appears to have a strong research background and addresses an important question. It focuses on the design of control algorithms for industrial servo systems within the context of industrial IoT, which is a significant area of research due to the increasing integration of IoT technologies in industrial applications. The paper specifically addresses the challenges of controlling a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) driven servo system using edge computing with semi-closed-loop feedbacks, high-order nonlinear disturbances, and lightweight implementation requirements. This is an important question as it aims to improve the performance and reliability of industrial servo systems, which are critical for various industrial processes.

Yes, the paper 'A Data Aggregation Framework based on Deep Learning for Mobile Crowd-sensing Paradigm' appears to have a strong research background and addresses an important question. It focuses on the mobile crowd sensing (MCS) paradigm, which is a significant area of research due to its potential to leverage human and machine intelligence for urban sensing problems. The paper highlights the challenges in ensuring data quality in edge-enabled MCS systems and proposes a framework using deep learning techniques to address these challenges. This is an important question as it aims to improve the quality and reliability of sensing data, which is crucial for the success of IoT applications that rely on MCS.

Yes, the paper "An Effective Cooperative Jamming-based Secure Transmission Scheme for a Mobile Scenario" has a strong research background and addresses an important question. It focuses on Physical Layer Security (PLS), which is a significant topic in wireless communications research. The paper addresses the challenge of enhancing security in mobile scenarios, which is often overlooked in current PLS schemes that typically consider static scenarios. By proposing a soft-handoff-based cooperative jamming scheme (CJSH), the paper aims to improve security performance in mobile environments, which is an important and relevant issue given the increasing mobility in wireless networks. The research also introduces new metrics and optimizes parameters to balance secrecy and power consumption, further contributing to the field.
