The algorithm design in "FEKNN: A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN" ensures feasibility and effectiveness by incorporating a Feature Enhancement Block that refines Received Signal Strength (RSS) values into context-rich, low-dimensional representations. This enhancement optimizes the data used for localization, improving accuracy. The algorithm balances deep learning methodologies with dataset size and attributes to achieve optimal performance in indoor localization. Components like the Feature Enhancement Block, Feature Database, and Weighted K-Nearest Neighbor (W-KNN) Function refine the distribution of RSSI data, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

In "A DRL-Based Hierarchical Game for Physical Layer Security Aware Cooperative Communications," the algorithm design ensures feasibility and effectiveness through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution. It includes a matching process and a coalition selection process for a double-sided matching subgame and a coalition formation subgame. This design models interactions among third-party collaborative users (TCUs), legitimate users (LUs), and eavesdroppers (EVs), deriving optimal long-term strategies and equilibrium in the hierarchical game. Numerical simulations demonstrate the solution's quick convergence and higher long-term performance compared to existing benchmarks.

The algorithm design in "An Interpretation Method for Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Based on GNNExplainer" ensures feasibility and effectiveness by introducing an interpreter that enhances the interpretability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in host intrusion detection systems. The interpreter adapts GNNExplainer for Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDSes) interpretation, showing improved interpretability over baseline methods. This enhanced interpretability enables security operators to understand IDS decision-making, efficiently analyze anomalies, and streamline the decision-making process, enhancing security operations' effectiveness and accuracy.
