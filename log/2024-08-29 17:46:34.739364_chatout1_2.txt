The content of "An Interpretation Method for Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Based on GNNExplainer" appears to introduce a novel approach to improving the interpretability of GNN-based host intrusion detection systems (IDS). By adapting an interpreter that helps security operators understand the decision-making process of the IDS, it aims to enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of security operations. This method addresses a significant barrier to the practical adoption of GNN-based systems, which is their lack of interpretability, thus potentially contributing to the existing knowledge system in the field of cybersecurity and intrusion detection.

The paper does conduct extensive experiments on both public datasets and a custom dataset to evaluate the efficacy of the FEKNN approach. It validates that the FEKNN achieves state-of-the-art performance in Wi-Fi indoor localization, with specific average localization errors reported (1.86 meters on the UjiIndoorLoc training dataset and 0.68 meters on the custom-built dataset). However, the provided context does not specify whether these experiments, statistics, and analyses are conducted in accordance with high-tech standards or describe them in sufficient detail. Therefore, I cannot definitively answer that part of your question.

The paper suggests that the proposed algorithm, DRL-SCLC, is feasible and effective, as it is designed to minimize position tracking error in a PMSM-driven servo system. The experimental results indicate that deploying the algorithm on the edge leads to better performance compared to cloud deployment, which suffers from larger communication delays that can cause vibration and instability in control decisions. Therefore, the algorithm appears to be both feasible and effective based on the findings presented in the study.
