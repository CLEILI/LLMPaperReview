The paper appears to have a strong research background, as it investigates a dynamic game framework for physical layer security (PLS) in wireless networks, which is a significant area of study given the vulnerabilities of legitimate users (LUs) to eavesdropping attacks. It addresses the important question of how third-party collaborative users (TCUs) can assist either LUs or eavesdroppers (EVs) and how their interactions and coalition formations can be optimized through a hierarchical game model. The integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to derive optimal long-term strategies further enhances the relevance of the research, indicating that it contributes valuable insights to the field of cooperative communications and security.

The paper 'An Effective Cooperative Jamming-based Secure Transmission Scheme for a Mobile Scenario' appears to present original research by addressing the challenges of physical layer security in mobile scenarios, particularly focusing on cooperative jamming and the mobility of users. It enhances the existing knowledge system by proposing a new scheme that incorporates soft handoff-based cooperative jamming, optimizing handoff thresholds, and introducing a new performance metric (power average security gain).

The paper presents two solutions for merging diverse blockchain systems, namely Homogeneous Chain Consolidation (HCC) and Heterogeneous Multi-chain Integration Architecture (HMIA). It addresses the need for integrating disparate blockchain networks, which is a relevant and significant topic as blockchain technology continues to expand. The proposed solutions aim to improve efficiency and scalability while balancing compatibility and autonomy among different chains. 

While the paper acknowledges that blockchain merging has received limited practical attention, it contributes to the existing knowledge by providing feasible solutions with negligible performance impact. The evaluation of these approaches using consensus times, block sizes, and ledger growth further enhances the understanding of their effectiveness. Therefore, it can be inferred that the content of the paper is original and contributes to the knowledge system in the area of blockchain merging.

The content of the paper 'BCPP-IAS: Blockchain-Based Cross-Domain Identity Authentication Scheme for IoT with Privacy Protection' appears to be original as it introduces a novel blockchain-based identity authentication scheme specifically designed to address issues related to low authentication efficiency and high communication overhead in traditional IoT identity authentication methods. The paper also proposes a certificateless aggregation signature algorithm that reduces computational overhead, which is particularly beneficial for IoT devices with limited resources. Additionally, it emphasizes privacy protection through the use of pseudonyms. Therefore, it seems to enhance the existing knowledge system in the area of secure cross-domain identity authentication for IoT by providing new solutions to identified challenges.

However, the authors also note that the training process of reinforcement learning may be affected by various factors, and further research is needed to enhance the stability and robustness of the algorithm. Therefore, while the algorithm appears to be feasible and effective based on the results presented, there are areas for improvement that need to be addressed in future work.
