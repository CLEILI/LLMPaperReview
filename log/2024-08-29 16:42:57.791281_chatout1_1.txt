    Assume you are a reviewer of a conference, your job is to review papers in ['BCPP-IAS Blockchain-Based Cross-Domain Identity Authentication Scheme for IoT with Privacy Protection', 'FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN', 'A Novel Merging Framework for Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Blockchain Systems', 'A DRL-Based Edge Intelligent Servo Control with Semi-Closed-Loop Feedbacks in Industrial IoT', 'A Flexible Numerology Resource Allocation to Guarantee Delay and Reliability Requirements in 5G NR-V2X Networks'] and give every paper a reasonable score.
    
    To find the paper related content, you are supposed to call the QuestionAnswer function.
    You cannot ask vague questions. It is recommended that your questions based on each of the following standords. 
    
    To review the papers, you should check that if every paper in ['BCPP-IAS Blockchain-Based Cross-Domain Identity Authentication Scheme for IoT with Privacy Protection', 'FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN', 'A Novel Merging Framework for Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Blockchain Systems', 'A DRL-Based Edge Intelligent Servo Control with Semi-Closed-Loop Feedbacks in Industrial IoT', 'A Flexible Numerology Resource Allocation to Guarantee Delay and Reliability Requirements in 5G NR-V2X Networks'] meets each of the following standards one bye one: 
    
    1. The paper should have a strong research background and address an important question.
    2. The paper should have a complete paper structure.
    3. The paper should have a clear theme, analysis, and conclusion.
    4. The content of the paper must be original to enhance the existing knowledge system in the given topic area.
    5. Experiments, statistics, and other analyses must be conducted in accordance with high-tech standards and described in sufficient detail. Experiments, data, and analysis should be able to support the current conclusion.
    6. If there is algorithm design, it is necessary to ensure that the algorithm is feasible and effective.
    7. The conclusion must be clear, correct, reliable, and valuable.
    8. The paper should have a certain contribution and driving effect on the given thematic area.
    
    Pay attention to using uniform evaluation standards for all papers. In your questions, there must be the paper's name.
    Here are the examples of your questions of paper named 'FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN':
    "Does the paper 'FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN' have a strong research background and address an important question?"
    "Does the paper 'FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN' have a complete paper structure?"
    "Does the paper 'FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN' have a clear theme, analysis, and conclusion?"
    "Is the content of 'FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN' original and does it enhance the existing knowledge system in the given topic area?"
    "Does the paper 'FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN' conduct experiments, statistics, and analyses in accordance with high-tech standards and describe them in sufficient detail?"
    "Is the algorithm in 'FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN' feasible and effective?"
    "Does the paper 'FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN' have a clear, correct, reliable, and valuable conclusion?"
    "Does the paper 'FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN' have a certain contribution and driving effect on the given thematic area?"

    After evaluating all the standards, you must think step by step, compare all papers and decide a final score of every paper based on the responses of all tool calls. (The maximum score is 100, which should be accurate to two decimal places.) 
    The review comments of each paper should be personalized and pertinence and it should include the advantages and disadvantages of corresponding paper.

    At last, you just need to reply every paper's information in the format of the following examples and terminate the conversation.
    Here is the examples format of two papers' information:
    {"comment": "This paper presents original and effective methodology for indoor localization, validated by extensive experiments. Further analysis on the algorithm's scalability could improve its contribution to the field.", "papername": "FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN", "score": "90.00"}
    {"comment": "It contributes valuable solutions for blockchain integration, demonstrating effective approaches for merging diverse systems. Inclusion of additional real-world case studies would enhance its practical relevance.", "papername": "A Novel Merging Framework for Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Blockchain Systems", "score": "80.00"}
