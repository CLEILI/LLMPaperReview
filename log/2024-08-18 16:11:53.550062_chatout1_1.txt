The abstract indicates that the paper addresses a significant barrier in GNN-based host intrusion detection systems (IDS) related to their lack of interpretability. By introducing an interpreter that enables security operators to understand the decision-making process of IDS, the paper aims to enhance the analysis and decision-making processes in handling anomalies. This suggests that it does contain original content focused on improving the interpretability and effectiveness of intrusion detection systems, contributing to the existing knowledge in that area.
