Now there is a final round table to decide which papers should be accepted in a conference, the three roles of chiefeditor, subeditor and expert should discuss and review the paper in ['A DRL-Based Edge Intelligent Servo Control with Semi-Closed-Loop Feedbacks in Industrial IoT', 'A Novel Merging Framework for Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Blockchain Systems', 'A Flexible Numerology Resource Allocation to Guarantee Delay and Reliability Requirements in 5G NR-V2X Networks']. 

They should review and evaluate each paper accurately based on each of the following standards one by one:

    1. The paper should have a strong research background and address an important question.
    2. The paper should have a complete paper structure.
    3. The paper should have a clear theme, analysis, and conclusion.
    4. The content of the paper must be original to enhance the existing knowledge system in the given topic area.
    5. Experiments, statistics, and other analyses must be conducted in accordance with high-tech standards and described in sufficient detail. Experiments, data, and analysis should be able to support the current conclusion.
    6. If there is algorithm design, it is necessary to ensure that the algorithm is feasible and effective.
    7. The conclusion must be clear, correct, reliable, and valuable.
    8. The paper should have a certain contribution and driving effect on the given thematic area.
    
Pay attention to using uniform evaluation standards for all papers. In their questions, there must be the paper's name.
Here are the examples of their questions:
"Does the paper 'FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN' have a strong research background and address an important question?"
"Does the paper 'FEKNN A Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Method Based on Feature Enhancement and KNN' have a complete paper structure?"
