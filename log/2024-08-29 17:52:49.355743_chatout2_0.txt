The paper appears to have a strong research background as it discusses the design of control algorithms crucial for industrial servo systems in the context of industrial IoT. It specifically focuses on a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)-driven servo system and proposes a novel control algorithm using deep reinforcement learning with semi-closed-loop feedbacks. This approach addresses the challenges of high-order nonlinear disturbances and lightweight implementation, which are significant in practical applications. Thus, it seems to address important questions related to control safety, reliability, and performance optimization in the industrial IoT context.
