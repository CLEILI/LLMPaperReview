Yes, 'A DRL-Based Edge Intelligent Servo Control with Semi-Closed-Loop Feedbacks in Industrial IoT' contributes to and drives the thematic area of industrial IoT by focusing on the design of control algorithms for industrial servo systems. It specifically addresses the challenges of high-order nonlinear disturbances and lightweight implementation requirements, which are crucial for the performance of PMSM-driven servo systems in various applications such as robotics, electric vehicles, and aerospace. The proposed deep reinforcement learning-based control algorithm enhances the functionality and performance of these systems, thereby advancing the field.

The paper "A DRL-Based Hierarchical Game for Physical Layer Security Aware Cooperative Communications" contributes to the thematic area by proposing a new hierarchical game framework that models the interactions among legitimate users (LUs), eavesdroppers (EVs), and third-party collaborative users (TCUs) in a dynamic wireless environment. By integrating a matching sub-game with a coalition formation sub-game, the authors effectively capture the complexities of cooperative communications and physical layer security. The use of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to derive optimal long-term strategies enhances the performance of the system and provides a solution that demonstrates superiority over existing benchmarks. This indicates that the paper does indeed drive the thematic area forward by addressing critical challenges in wireless network security and cooperation.

Yes, the BCPP-IAS (Blockchain-Based Cross-Domain Identity Authentication Scheme for IoT with Privacy Protection) contributes to and drives the thematic area of secure communication and efficient identity authentication in large-scale multi-domain Internet of Things (IoT) environments. It addresses key issues such as low authentication efficiency and high communication overhead found in traditional identity authentication schemes, while also enhancing privacy protection through the use of pseudonyms. The scheme's design and theoretical analysis demonstrate its security and efficiency, making it a significant advancement in the field.
